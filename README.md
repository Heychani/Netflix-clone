# Netflix-clone

Netflix clone built with HTML, CSS and JS using Vue framework

Welcome, the Netflix Clone I have built was something I took to heart, challenged myself and pushed my boundaries as well as myself out of my comfort-zone when it comes to designing.

I first created the app in a Figma file https://www.figma.com/file/n7bxpOCxq18RttZs0nWJkj/Netflix-Clone?node-id=0%3A1 where I laid out the basics, the school rubric and how I would be taking on the app.

The application is very user-friendly, not to much information on any of the pages, neither an overload. Everything is quite clear and easy accessible.

There are 6 HTML files, 6 CSS files and 2 JavaScript files:

Page one: Splash Page

- index.html
- stylesheet.css

Page two: Sign in

- signIn.html
- signIn.css

Page three: Sign up page

- create.html
- create.css

Page four: Who is watching the different profiles

- whoIsWatching.html
- whoIsWatching.css

Page five: Homepage

- homepage.html
- homepage.css
- homepage.js

Page Six: My Watchlist

- watchlist.html
- watchlist.css
- watchlist.js

The app will be an ongoing project of my, but for now this is the criteria I should've met for a school project.
